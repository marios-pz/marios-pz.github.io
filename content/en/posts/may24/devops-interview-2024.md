This blog contains a recurring pattern I've personally
identified during DevOps technical interview. This
blog is for **everyone** whether you're already a DevOps engineer
or just starting up your journey.

Before we start I would like to add a **crucial note**,
the insights here are from a **personal experience and research**.
and by no means has every possible question.
To maintain clarity and conciseness, I won't provide answers beneath each question discussed.
Instead I'll focus on giving the **big picture**.

# Technical Interview

You start with general questions, then move to technologies and maybe
scenario based questions were they will test your **problem solving**.

## General Questions

- What is DevOps and how it took your interest
- What does DevOps differ from traditional IT operations?
- Explain the key principles of DevOps.
- What are some benefits of implementing DevOps practices?
- What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?
- Describe the concept of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

## Technologies

- Explain the difference between a **Container** and a **Virtual Machine**
- Explain the purpose of configuration management tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef etc.
- What is Kubernetes and what are its main components.
- Explain how cron jobs work
- Explain how chmod works
- Can you write a simple script to automate a task using Bash or Python?
- Explain how to create and use a Dockerfile.

## Scenario-Based Questions:

- A **Classic**, Given a scenario where a deployment has failed, how would you rollback and investigate the issue?
- If a new team member is unfamiliar with a critical tool in your pipeline, how would you onboard them?
- How would you design a highly available and fault-tolerant architecture for a web application?

# Assingment

## Environment

You will be given an environment that reflects the real-world environment you'll likely be working
in as a DevOps professional, where collaboration, version control, and
continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD) pipelines are essential components of the development lifecycle.
and your assignment is inside a repository.
Document your process, its a crucial aspect of navigating a DevOps technical interview successfully.
As you tackle the assignment within the designated repository,
it's essential to maintain clear and concise documentation of every step you take.

## Tasks

The point of the assignment is for them to see you apply "DevOps"
principles to the repository. You are responsible for designing the infrastructure
and ensuring the application is deployed.

Here is a list of the task:

- Create Dockerfile
- Create Docker-Compose
- Create IaC
- Create Kubernetes Manifests (if they use K8s)
- Design the CI/CD

# Resources to prepare

- Watch "DevOps Interview Questions" on YT
- Practice daily with DevOps tools and such on projects
- Read books such as "System Design Interview".

## Conclusion

Succeeding a DevOps technical interview involves understanding core principles,
honing technical skills, and showcasing problem-solving abilities and communication skills.
Stay adaptable, embrace collaboration, and approach each interview as an opportunity to learn and grow.
