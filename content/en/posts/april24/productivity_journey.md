## How to become productivity freak

This blog is aimed at individuals who find it challenging to be productive.
Before we jump into the content, it's crucial to understand that we are not
alone in facing this struggle and many others face this problem as well.
Therefore its best to help everybody.

## Things to consider

Creating habits, especially entirely new ones, is hardest on the soul.
Taking it slow at the start and gradually beginning to apply them all.

## Analyze situation

Seek input from others, find your weakness and create a master plan.
Ask your friends about your strengths and weaknesses.

## use SWOT

What is SWOT you ask? SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.
It is a strategic planning tool used to identify and evaluate these
four aspects of a project or situation.
By analyzing these factors, you can gain insights into
their internal strengths and weaknesses,
as well as external opportunities and threats.
This process helps in making informed decisions and developing effective strategies.

_Here is a silly example video from Silicon Valley series._

## Visual Planning

Imagine a every week you have a visual board, filled with tasks into different columns.
You can easily see what needs to be done, what's in progress, and what's completed.
As you work on tasks, you move them across the board,
giving you a clear picture of your progress.
This method helps you stay organized, prioritize effectively, and adapt to changes.
It's like having a roadmap for your studies that keeps you on track and makes
managing your academic tasks much smoother.

## Habit Tracker

When you try something new, its hard staying on track. So we need to _award_
ourselfs with dopamine.

Habit trackers facilitate self-reflection by helping you track and
assess your daily habits and goals, contributing to your overall
personal development journey. Being able to analyze your progress helps
you stay motivated and most important of all, stay disciplined.

[Habitica](https://habitica.com/) is a popular Free and Open Source
Habit tracker that you could try.

## Early Rise, Early Triumph

When you wake up, fix the bed, eat breakfast and
then do the hardest thing in the day. Do not touch your phone.

By ensuring that the hardest task is finished in the morning,
it will allow you to be more flexible for the rest of the day.

## Minimize Social Media

Keep social media usage strictly need-based, such as reading important announcements
or connecting with like-minded individuals on niche forums.
Say no to pointless chitchat, attention-seeking behaviors,
and toxic environments that drain your mental energy.
Put yourself to offline status, and gradually become less and less active.

## Kick the Coffee Habit

Caffeine has its benefits, but it disrupts sleep patterns
and can cause headaches if the daily intake is not regulated.
Since we aim to tackle our hardest task in the morning,
it's essential not to rely on coffee beforehand. Based on personal feedback,
I've found that it takes around 1-2 weeks for the addiction to subside.
After that time, we saw that sleep patterns gradually improved,
and individuals found themselves bursting with energy in the morning.

## Conclusion

This is merely the surface, but the first steps are the most crucial ones.
I will delve more in-depth in separate self-improvement blogs.
